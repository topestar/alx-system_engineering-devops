# Web server

In this project, I learned how web servers work and began using one. I was
provided a personal server by ALX. I learned how to use `scp`
and Fabric to transfer files to my server. Additionally, I completed a basic
configuration of the server using Nginx.

The server is accessible at [bdbnb.site](http://bdbnb.site).
